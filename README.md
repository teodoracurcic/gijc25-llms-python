# No-Code Guide to Using Python for Journalists

Welcome to a series of **Jupyter Notebooks** designed to help journalists explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python and AI tools like ChatGPT — **without prior coding experience**.  

This workshop was prepared for the **[2025 Global Investigative Journalism Conference (GIJC25)](https://gijc2025.org)**, held **20-24 November 2025, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**.  

Here you will find practical exercises ranging from **cleaning datasets**, **mapping pirate attacks**, to **web scraping** for real data. The focus is on learning by doing, asking the right questions, and understanding what the code is doing.

## Notebook Overview

### [Merge and Clean Data]
- **Goal:** Learn to merge multiple CSV files, clean inconsistent data, and prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Focus:** Using Python and ChatGPT to simplify tasks like standardizing column names, handling missing values, and understanding data.
- **Takeaway:** Even large datasets (tens of thousands of rows) can be cleaned and prepared in a few lines of code.

### [Create a Map]
- **Goal:** Organize and visualize a real-world dataset of **pirate attacks worldwide** on an interactive map.
- **Focus:**  
  - Prepare data for mapping  
  - Use `attack_type` as a category for different icons  
  - Handle overlapping coordinates and clustering  
  - Mobile-friendly display with popups and dynamic legend  
- **Takeaway:** Step-by-step preparation and mapping make analysis much easier.

### [Scrape House Rental Listings]
- **Goal:** Learn how to **extract real data automatically from websites** using Python.
- **Focus:**  
  - Understand HTML structure  
  - Identify tags, classes, and attributes  
  - Extract, clean, and organize data into tables  
  - Use ChatGPT to guide coding for scraping tasks
- **Takeaway:** Python can automate data collection, saving hours of manual work.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Workshop

- The more you **understand Python**, HTML, and how your dataset works, the more you can do independently.  
- **Limited resources?** AI tools like ChatGPT can help, but **verification is crucial**. Always check results.  
- **Testing matters:** Run your code often and validate outputs.  
- **Repetition helps:** Don’t be afraid to repeat steps, even if you’ve written the code before.  
- **Be concrete:** For example, in your dataset `pirates`, you might ask:  
  *“In my DataFrame called `pirates` I have a column `attack_type`; I want to count how many unique types there are.”*  
- **Ask questions:** Examples include  
  - *“How do I do this correctly?”*  
  - *“Why isn’t this working?”*  
  - *“What’s the best way to approach this task?”*
